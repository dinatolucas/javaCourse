#**My Java and OOP Course Repository**

Welcome to the repository for my Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Here, I am documenting my learning journey, storing example codes, practical projects, and challenging exercises as I progress through the course.

**Contents:**

- **Example Codes:** Explore the codes I've implemented during the lessons to gain a better understanding of Java concepts.

- **Practical Projects:** Documentation of the practical projects I'm working on to apply OOP principles in real-world scenarios.

- **Exercises:** Repository of solved exercises to reinforce what I've learned during the course.

Let's learn together! ðŸš€
